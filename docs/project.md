The designer is a wysiwig screen design tool that facilitates the placement of widgets on SPA (Single Page Application) style screens.

#### The technology Stack

The use of Microsoft's Blazor front-end tool enables the development of secure front-ends that do not include javascript.

The use of Web Assembler (wasm) allows the front end to be compiled, and rendered at runtime for speed and responsiveness.
The use of Web Assembler will also allow webspinner.com to be used for Web3 applications hosted on platforms such as Ethereum's EVM.

The backend is programmed with Golang gin which may be run in containers within Kubernetes clusters or virtual cloud environments.

### Delivery Model

webspinner.com will host a SaaS version of the solution for trials and pay-as-you-use patrons. 

A PaaS version may also be deployed to on-premise, hybrid, and multicloud environments.
